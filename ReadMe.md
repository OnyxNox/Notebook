## Scripts

### [Anti-Idle](./Scripts/AntiIdle.ps1)

Prevent Windows from going idle without any software dependencies. This is useful for machines that have strict administration policies and need to run a script for extended period of time.

### [Reset RDP Window](./Scripts/ResetRdpWindow.ps1)

Move and resize RDP window to fit monitor left of the primary monitor. This is useful because when a RDP window is restored from maximization, for an unknown reason, it slightly grows in size and this script quickly resets its position and size.
